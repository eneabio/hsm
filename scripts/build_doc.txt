To use this script it's necessary first of all install Sphinx (>pip install sphinx).
After you have unstalled Sphinx you can use this script for generate documentation.
There are three passages:
	- verify that your setup.py has the row scripts=['scripts/build_doc.py'];
	- in the directory where is your setup.py run >python setup.py build_scripts;
	- in the same directory run >python scripts/build_doc.py.

When sphinx-quickstart is launched, it will create for you the directories/files necessary
with defualt config. It will call you other information that you can choice what ever you want but
I suggest these:
	- Root path for the documentation [.]: enter
	- Separate source and build directories (y/N) [n]: enter
	- Name prefix for templates and static dir [_]: enter
	- Project name: Hsm
	- Author name(s): Fabio F. Filasieno
	- Project version: 0.1.3
	- Project release [0.1.3]: enter
	- Source file suffix [.rst]: enter
	- Name of your master document (without suffix) [index]: enter
	- Do you want to use the epub builder (y/N) [n]: enter
	- autodoc: automatically insert docstrings from modules (y/N) [n]: y
	- doctest: automatically test code snippets in doctest blocks (y/N) [n]: enter
	- intersphinx: link between Sphinx documentation of different projects (y/N) [n]: enter
	- todo: write "todo" entries that can be shown or hidden on build (y/N) [n]: enter
	- coverage: checks for documentation coverage (y/N) [n]: enter
	- pngmath: include math, rendered as PNG images (y/N) [n]: enter
	- mathjax: include math, rendered in the browser by MathJax (y/N) [n]: enter
	- ifconfig: conditional inclusion of content based on config values (y/N) [n]: enter
	- viewcode: include links to the source code of documented Python objects (y/N) [n]: y
	- Create Makefile? (Y/n) [y]: n
	- Create Windows command file? (Y/n) [y]: n


When the script has finished you can view html files in docs/_build
